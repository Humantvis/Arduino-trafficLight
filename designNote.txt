Design:
Arduino Uno controls 3 LEDs (red/yellow/green) and an I2C LCD.
Button press triggers a timed crossing cycle.
EEPROM stores press counter across resets.


Timing budget:

Timer1 configured in CTC mode at 1 Hz (OCR1A = 15624).

Total cycle = 10s (5s wait, 5s walk).


Test/accuracy results:

Verified red/yellow/green transitions match expected times.

EEPROM press counter is correct after turning the Arduino off and turning it back on.


Known issues:

The button sometimes does nor register as pressed.

Multiple presses during cycle do not restart countdown.
